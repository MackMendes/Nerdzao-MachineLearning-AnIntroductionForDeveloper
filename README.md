# Machine Learning: an introduction for Developers - Nerdzão Portugal
In this repository you have the two demonstrations I made in the Nerdzão Portugal [#13 LIVE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXRnLtRPtIg) and [#13.2 LIVE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXe3SJ83JDo) to show an introduction to Machine Learning.

The items I presented were:
1. What is Machine Learning?
    * History
    * Why only in recent years? 
    * Objectives 
2. Main types of machine learning algorithms & Technologies
3. Demonstration 1
4. Metrics
6. Consuming Models
5. Black-box
7. Demonstration 2
8. Starting the study

This representation is available in the [presentation](https://github.com/MackMendes/Nerdzao-MachineLearning-AnIntroductionForDeveloper/blob/master/presentation/Machine%20Learning%20-%20An%20introduction%20for%20Developers.pdf) folder within this repository.

I made two demonstrations to:
* show the difference in practice between supervised and unsupervised Machine Learning;
* show ONNX technology in practice;

The demonstrations are:

## Demo 1
To perform the demonstration, I used the dataset Iris (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris) with the language R:

More details in [Demo1](https://github.com/MackMendes/Nerdzao-MachineLearning-AnIntroductionForDeveloper/tree/master/Demo1) folder in this repository.

## Demo 2
In this demo, I show the ONNX technology in action: a statistical model was created in Python and this model will be used in C# to make a prediction of a number drawn:
